# HITL-Framework-for-Companion-Computers 

This repository will host the code and resources for a deployable Hardware-in-the-Loop (HITL) framework tailored for testing autonomous navigation programs on companion computers.  

## Goal  
To provide a lightweight, easily deployable solution that mimics flight controllers and environments, enabling developers to test navigation programs on their companion computers without requiring direct drone hardware.  

## Current Status  
Work in progress. Stay tuned for updates!  

## Planned Features  
- Companion computer detection and communication.  
- Emulation of flight controller signals.  
- Integration with Gazebo and ROS environments.  

## License  
MIT License.
